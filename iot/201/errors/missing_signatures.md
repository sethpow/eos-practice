ERROR:
    transaction declares authority '{"actor":"james","permission":"active"}', 
    but does not have signatures for it.

I just created a new key pair (bottom left green key button), and then with the Account button (top right button, right by Network) I made the account name the person/people I want to use as owner/actor.

So to get rid of the error, I had to have the Account button say the name of the owner/actor I was pushing actions for.
