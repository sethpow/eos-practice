Transaction fees (ETH) vs rental mode (EOS)

EOSIO
--------------------
3 main resources:
    - CPU (actual computations)
    - Network (bandwidth used to send information)
    - Memory (where data is stored)

Rental
    - To execute TX's, need resources; gain resources (CPU & Net) through staking
        - CPU (actual computations)
        - Network (bandwidth used to send information)

    - Lock resources in EOSIO contract to gain access to CPU & Net
        - Using in transactions
            - CPU runs/performs code
            - Net sends and receives data
        - Once TX is sent, no more computation needs to be done
            - CPU and Net can then be used by someone else
            - Pay to rent these as a developer, making transactions free for the customers (no TX fees)

Memory
    - Go to memory marketplace, where you can buy/sell memory
    - Price fluctuates depending on supply/demand
        - Purchase X amount of EOS to purchase desired memory
    - You own that storage; nobody else has access to it until you clear it and sell
