What is an action?


Explicit actions vs implicit (inline) actions:
    - Differ in the way they are executed by EOSIO
        - Both are defined in SC code. Key difference is that inline actions are not included in the actual transactions propagated through the network and eventually incluced in a block; they are implicit
        
    - explicit: present in a signed TX
    - implicit: created as a side effect of processing a TX
