allow you to "filter" and then perform CRUD actions accordingly

can specify multiple keys, called secondary keys; go along side the PK
these secondary keys can be used to find sets of data from any of the other var's that're part of table structure
can filter on these var's

edit the typedef for the table

ex:
    find all Bob's dogs and delete them
    change all Steves cats to lizards
