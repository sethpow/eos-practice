    rich retrieval capabilities - up to 16 secondary indices can be defined, each having its own way of ordering and retrieving table contents; this allows multiple views on same table, different value types if needed

    retrieve multiple views of the same table
    simplify the way to go thru the elements of lists or records of the table
    iterate thru to retrieve next/prev item
    can return a reference or obj instance
